# Markdown Support


Stardate 98679.95


There is currently no cure for AD and no reliable method for early detection. The disease is characterized by plaques and fibrils formed in the brain. However, these plaques are not direct indicators of the disease, demanding further research into the aggregation process and its role. I am using a small-angle x-ray scattering technique to obtain structural (and temporal) information of aggregated proteins associated with  Alzheimer's, specifically alpha-syn A532 and tau 383 0N4R. 

I will keep all my lab entrees on this site for easy access. Live long and prosper. 

Here is [the PDF](/files/research_proposal_phys407.pdf) of my proposal for this semesters research.

## Basic Formatting

With Markdown, it is possible to emphasize words by making them *italicized*, using *astericks* or _underscores_, or making them **bold**, using **double astericks** or __double underscores__. Of course, you can combine those two formats, with both _**bold and italicized**_ text, using any combination of the above syntax. You can also add a strikethrough to text using a ~~double tilde~~.


## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers - like GitHub or most Jekyll themes - support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. You can find the full list of supported programming languages [here](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers). Also, it is possible to do `inline code blocks`, by wrapping the text in ` ` ` quotations.

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
```

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

{% highlight js %}
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
{% endhighlight %}

Another option is to embed your code through [Gist](https://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/).

## Unordered and Numbered Lists

You can make an unordered and nested list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-`, `*`, or `+`, and indenting sublists. The following lists show the full range of possible list formats.

* List item one
    * List item one
        * List item one
        * List item two
        * List item three
        * List item four
    * List item two
    * List item three
    * List item four
* List item two
* List item three
* List item four

Numbered lists are made by using numbers instead of bullet points.

1. List item one
    1. List item one
        1. List item one
        2. List item two
        3. List item three
        4. List item four
    2. List item two
    3. List item three
    4. List item four
2. List item two
3. List item three
4. List item four

## MathJax Example

The [Schr√∂dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

[Joseph-Louis Millennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Millennial) was an Italian mathematician and astronomer who was responsible for the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics, which is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac {\partial  L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right ) =  \frac {\partial L}{\partial q_j} $$

## Embedding

Plenty of social media sites offer the option of embedding certain parts of their site on your own site, such as YouTube and Twitter:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mthtn1X4eUY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<a class="twitter-grid" data-partner="tweetdeck" href="https://twitter.com/paululele/timelines/755079130027352064">New Collection</a> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, which you can mix with Markdown if you like. A complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

## Horizontal Rule

Can be created by having three or more hyphens `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`:
